  Phrozen OS images "correctly" truncated to fit micro-sd 
  cards without the Operating System complaining about it 
  thinking it's a 30GB micro-sd card but it can only find 
  8GB, and so you can do what you need from yet another
  Raspberry Pi (or the like) with a smallish root file
  system that doesn't have 30 fucking GB of free space to
  contain the (30 - 4) GB of free-space that takes up space,
  because certain "professionals" don't know what they're
  doing...
 
 
   You shouldn't need a windows machine or a Mac with some
  bullshit alternative to dd for writing an operating 
  system to a "disk"
